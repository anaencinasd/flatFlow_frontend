# Flat Flow - Frontend

![Under Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-under%20development-blue)

## Overview

Welcome to the frontend of the **Flat Flow** application! The mission is to enhance the quality of cohabitation in shared living spaces, catering to individuals who live together without familial ties. According to data from the Idealista real estate portal, the average age of individuals sharing a living space is around 34 years. In this project, I address the improvement of cohabitation in existing shared living arrangements. My goal is to create a tool that enhances established cohabitation through the organization and planning of space usage, routines, and responsibilities.

## Project Description

**Flat Flow** is a web platform designed to improve cohabitation in shared living spaces. It empowers users to communicate effectively, organize and assign household tasks, and track shared expenses.
