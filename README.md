Flat Flow - Frontend
Under Development

Welcome to the frontend of the Flat Flow application! Our mission is to enhance the quality of cohabitation in shared living spaces, catering to individuals who live together without familial ties. According to data from the Idealista real estate portal, the average age of individuals sharing a living space is around 34 years. In this project, we address the improvement of cohabitation in existing shared living arrangements. Our goal is to create a tool that enhances established cohabitation through the organization and planning of space usage, routines, and responsibilities.

Project Overview
Flat Flow is a web platform designed to improve cohabitation in shared living spaces. It empowers users to communicate effectively, organize and assign household tasks, and track shared expenses.
